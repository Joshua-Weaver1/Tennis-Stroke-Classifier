# ECM3401 Individual Project: Tennis Shot Classification with Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my ECM3401 Individual Project, focusing on the classification of tennis shots using machine learning algorithms. The project involves comparing various machine learning algorithms implemented in Python to classify tennis shots (forehand, backhand, and overhead) from inertial sensor data stored in CSV files.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the CSV files containing inertial sensor data for different tennis shots.
- **models/**: Includes trained machine learning models and scripts for model evaluation.
- **plots/**: Includes scatter models and plot for data visualisation.
- **README.md**: You are here! The main documentation for the project.
